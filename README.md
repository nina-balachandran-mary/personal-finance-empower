## Welcome to the personal finance tracker
This SPA currently utilizes mock data present under `src/assets/data` to pseudo emulate responses from the Plaid API.
In addition, a few assumptions have been during development, namely that trackers and expense report are 
measured against weekly expenditures to make things relatively simple.
The app also includes mock categories to categorize expenses. You can find the mock categories under
`src/assets/data`.


## How to run the app

To start you will need Node v18.19.0 or higher installed on your machine. You will need to run `npm i` to install all package
dependencies to run the app locally.

Once done, run the following commands in the project directory

### `npm start`

### `npm run server`

This will start the application at port 3000. [Click here](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
